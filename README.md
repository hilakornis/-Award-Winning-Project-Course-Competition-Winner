# Internet-of-things-final-project-Robocode-
Internet of things(IoT): Written software in Java, C, JavaScript, for Arduino based educational robot.
## Description
RoboCode is an interactive platform, built as a forklift machine robot game. The player chooses a task via the app that RoboCode needs to execute and must configure a set of cards, in a “pseudo code” way, that dictates RoboCode steps. Thus, we can simplify the teaching programmatical thinking and algorithmic problems solving in an intuitive and fun way!

Written software in Java, C, JavaScript, for Arduino based educational robot.
